# Real Estate Management

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for real estate property management, showcasing my data visualization and analysis skills. The dashboard features various visualizations, including a bar chart for properties by bedroom count, cards for total properties and waterfront status percentages, and a line chart indicating the number of properties built over the years. I integrated a map to display property locations across different states and applied extensive formatting to enhance visual appeal. Custom DAX measures calculated key metrics, while interactive elements like filters and a custom hide/show functionality improved user experience. The project was published to the Power BI service for online access, with a focus on mobile responsiveness and performance optimization. This comprehensive dashboard effectively facilitates real estate analytics and informed decision-making.
